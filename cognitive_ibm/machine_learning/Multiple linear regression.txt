# Multiple linear regression
	* multiple independent variables present
	* This is the extension of simple linear regression
	* when should we use it
		* Two main application:
			* when we want to identify the strength of the effect that the independent variables have on a dependent variable


* Predicting the impact of changes
	* How much does blood pressure go up or down for every unit increase or decrease in the BMI of a patient?
	* This is also a method of predicting a continuous variable
	* The target value y is a linear combination of the multiple independent variables
	* Theta is also call parameters or weight of vectors

* goal minimized the error of the prediction by optimizing the parameters
* optimize parameters is the one that leads to the fewest errors

* objective is to minise the MSE
* how do you estimate the value of the coefficients
	* The most common methods are ordinary least squares and optimization approach
	* ordinary Least squares = minimizes the MSE. Estimate the values of the coefficients by minimizing the MSE
