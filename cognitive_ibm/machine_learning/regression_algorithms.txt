# Regression algorithms
#### Can we  preidict the co2 emission for a 9 car 
	* The dependen variables is highly dependent on the independent variables
	* the key point to remember is that the dependent variable should be continuous

We use regression as the model to predict the amount of emission every new car produces

* simple regression
	* with one independent variable is present
	* it could be non-liner regression or linear regression
* multiple regression
	* multiple independent variables
	* it could be linear regression or non-linear regression

* Essentially we use regression when we want to estimate a continuous value
	* One application could be sales forecasting
	* satisfaction analysis
	* price estimation
	* Employment income
	*

Regression algorithms
	* Ordinal regression]
	* poisson regression
	# fast forest quantile regression
	* linear, polynomial, lasso, stepwise, Ridge regression
	* Bayesian linear regression
	* neural network regression
	* decision forest regression
	* boosted decision tree regression
	* KNN (K-nearest neighbors)

# Linear regression
	We can use linear regression to predict a continues variable using the independent variables
		* 	parameters (coefficients of the fit line) should be minimized to avoid a large unit error or residual value ÿ - y 
		* The idea is to find have to lowest MSE for the entire line
	
Two ways to find the coefficients:
		1. First you use the data
			* find the average of the independent and dependent variable
			* then use the formula to find theta 1

Plug theta one once you find it and you will find theta 0 by calculation

Theta 0 = biased coefficient
Theta 1 = coefficient for the co2emissions 

You don’t need to remember the formula because python can easily find this parameters for you

This is the most basic regression and fast. It doesn’t required tunning of parameters
	This is highly interpreter
