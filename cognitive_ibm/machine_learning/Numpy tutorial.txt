# Numpy tutorial
1. Numpy is a multidimensional array library. You can use Numpy to store all sorts of data

	* why do you use Numpy over list?
		* The main difference comes from the speed, lists are very slow, meanwhile Numpy is very fast 
			* The reason for this is Numpy uses fixed types
			* lists use a build in n-type while Numpy arrays scaled depending on the number
			* lists requires your to have a size, reference count, object type, and object value. Each one is an 8 byte long scape
			* so lists requires a lot more space and the computer needs to read more 
			* No type checking when iterating through objects
			* Numpy array uses continue memory while the pointer based
				* SIMD vector processing, perform computation of all the values at one time
				* We used effectively Cache utilization
	* Within numpy you can do loads more than lists

Applications of numpy?
	* Mathematics (matlab replacement) -scifi library has even more
	* 	it is useful for plotting
	* this is the backend of many applications( pandas, connect 4, digital photography)
	* machine learning - this is the idea of tensor, so tensor library is pretty connected to numpy
