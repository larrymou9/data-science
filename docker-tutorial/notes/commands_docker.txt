# Docker commands
* docker pull to download an image 
* docker run hello-world
* docker images
* docker run busybox
* docker run busybox echo "hello from busybox"

# Process on containers
* docker ps
* docker ps -a
* docker run -it busybox sh
* docker run --help

# Removing containers

* docker rm c46616a33539 1720a56aa12c bca11c2b6451
* On deletion, you should see the IDs echoed back to you. If you have a bunch of containers to delete in one go, copy-pasting IDs can be tedious. In that case, you can simply run -
$ docker rm $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited)
* you can also ass flag â€”rm at the end of you run command
* In later versions of Docker, the docker container prune command can be used to achieve the same effect.

# Removing images you no longer need
* docker rmi

# Terminology
## Terminology
In the last section, we used a lot of Docker-specific jargon which might be confusing to some. So before we go further, let me clarify some terminology that is used frequently in the Docker ecosystem.
* Images - The blueprints of our application which form the basis of containers. In the demo above, we used the docker pull command to download the busybox image.
* Containers - Created from Docker images and run the actual application. We create a container using docker run which we did using the busybox image that we downloaded. A list of running containers can be seen using the docker ps command.
* Docker Daemon - The background service running on the host that manages building, running and distributing Docker containers. The daemon is the process that runs in the operating system to which clients talk to.
* Docker Client - The command line tool that allows the user to interact with the daemon. More generally, there can be other forms of clients too - such as  [Kitematic](https://kitematic.com/)  which provide a GUI to the users.
* Docker Hub - A  [registry](https://hub.docker.com/explore/)  of Docker images. You can think of the registry as a directory of all available Docker images. If required, one can host their own Docker registries and can use them for pulling images.
